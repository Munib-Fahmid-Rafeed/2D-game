# 2D-game using Python language (Computer Graphics project)
2D game, Rainbow Brick Buster. Its like the classic Dx ball game. However, it only uses the principle of midpoint line and midpoint circle algorithms. Please download the zip openGL (then exact it) and the python source file in order to run it smoothly. The openGL folder and the source code have to stay in the same folder.
